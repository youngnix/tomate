# Tomate!

The necessity for this project arose when I noticed that most desktop timer applications are either too simple or do not meet my demands.

## Demands
- Simplicity - The timer should be simple to use.
- Customizability - The user should be able to customize the timer however he likes.
- Performance - It should be fast and consume few resources.
